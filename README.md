got giphy finder is yur very own simple web application to get gifs for your favourite Game of Thrones character.
all you have to do is type in a name or select one from a list of goats and get you GIF.

a goal : the goal of this project is to give a easy user friendly way to get your char. even if you firget their name

functionality: type or select from a long list of names to get your GIF that simple , you have the option of choosing up to 5 GIFs

challenges : at the very first step we faced a problem with the API, we wanted a search depending on a char. name and the api search was with char. ID so after a lot of research we found an API that will provide us with good number of char. (53 to be precise), and that API does not work all the time so we we needed to find a backup if the API fails.

another challenge was merging between a dropdown-list and an input-->type=text which eventually we found a way to do.
